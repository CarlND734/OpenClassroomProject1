            <h3>Career Objective: Computer Repair Technician</h3>
            <p>Growing up I played a bunch of video games growing up, but we didn't have much money. So when equipment broke or a problem came up it was my job to fix it. This grew into my passion of being a Computer Repair Technician since I liked the tinkering aspect and being able to solve problems.</p>
